# CAT-Net: A Cross-Slice Attention Transformer Model for Prostate Zonal Segmentation in MRI

The official code for our TMI paper [CAT-Net: A Cross-Slice Attention Transformer Model for Prostate Zonal Segmentation in MRI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9910184)

There is a followup work of this paper, which is accepted at WACV, [CSAM: A 2.5D Cross-Slice Attention Module for Anisotropic Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation](https://github.com/aL3x-O-o-Hung/CSAM)
